"Okay, thank you for that clarification.  So if the positive test in fact was what led to the hospital admission and related costs, and you believe the physician or hospital was negligent or breached their duty of care by admitting you to the hospital, you may want to consult with an attorney who handles medical malpractice cases.  Professional malpractice cases are very fact specific, so I would suggest meeting with an attorney to see if you have a viable case and whether the physician or hospital staff breached their duty of care under your specific circumstances.  You may want to contact the Wyoming State Bar's Lawyer Referral Service at ###-### for a list of attorneys who handle medical malpractice cases, or you can search the Lawyer Referral Service directory online at https://www.wyomingbar.org/.  In the Area of Law, select General Litigation > Malpractice (Medical).  Many attorneys who handle malpractice or personal injury cases offer free initial consultations, so if you contact an attorney on the list, you may want to see if they offer a free initial consultation.  Best of luck to you.

That is, you won't owe an attorney's fee unless the lawyer wins the case.I encourage you to use the internet to search for lawyers in your area who handle ### cases.
