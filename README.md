## Project Overview
Welcome to our DataFest 2023 project, hosted at SMU! In this project, we tackled the challenge of making the American Bar Association (ABA) data more accessible and user-friendly. We utilized machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to generate insights about which race, gender, and ethnic groups asked specific types of questions, ultimately assisting these groups more effectively. Additionally, we leveraged this data to create a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) to enhance user experience.

We obtained our dataset from the American Bar Association (ABA). This dataset contained a wide range of information about the questions asked by various individuals, including their demographic information.

## Project Goals
Our project had two primary objectives:

**Demographic Analysis:** We aimed to understand how different demographic groups (race, gender, and ethnicity) interacted with the ABA's information. By identifying trends, we hoped to improve the ABA's outreach and services to diverse communities.

**FAQ Generation:** We used machine learning and AI techniques to generate a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) based on the questions asked by users. This would serve as a valuable resource for users seeking quick answers to common queries.

## Technologies Used
We harnessed the power of several technologies to accomplish our goals, including:

Python
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries
Machine Learning algorithms
Artificial Intelligence techniques
Data Preprocessing
Cleaning and preparing the data was a crucial step in our project. We handled missing values, removed duplicates, and transformed the dataset into a format suitable for analysis. This preprocessing step was essential for accurate insights and FAQ generation.

## Machine Learning
To analyze and categorize the questions asked by users, we employed machine learning algorithms. Our models used natural language processing techniques to classify questions into different categories based on their content. This allowed us to identify patterns in the types of questions asked by various demographic groups.

## FAQ Generation
Using the insights gained from the machine learning models, we created a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs). These FAQs were generated from the most common questions asked by users and are intended to provide quick answers to common queries, improving the user experience.

## Usage
Check out the Jupyter notebooks (Tanish/main & Tanish/PredictingDemandWithData) for how we generated our graphs. There are also Python files there that direct you to how we generated the FAQs.
